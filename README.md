# Asteroids Game (Pygame)

Hey! This is a simple Asteroids-style game built with Python and Pygame.  
You control a player circle using the arrow keys and just move around the screen for now. It’s a small project to get familiar with Pygame basics and game loops.

## What’s inside?

- A window that runs at a smooth 60 FPS  
- A player you can move around with **WASD** (Up(W), Down(S), Left(A), Right(D))  
- Clean code split into modules for easy reading and editing

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install Pygame:

```bash
pip install pygame
```
---

Note for Mac users:
If you’re using a Mac and your terminal defaults to zsh (which it does on newer macOS versions), the above command works exactly the same. Just open your Terminal app and run it as shown.

If you have multiple Python versions installed, you might need to use pip3 instead:

```bash
pip3 install pygame
```
## After that run:

```bash
python main.py
```

OR if you use Python 3, you can just use:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
Thanks for checking it out! If you want help adding features or improving it, just ask otherwise enjoy!
